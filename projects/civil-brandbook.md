Our research indicated that attitudes toward blockchain among our potential customers ranged from distrust to fear to a sense of exclusion from what they perceived as a complicated, highly technical world. It was important to create a brand that was reassuring, authoritative, and that inspired trust. We didn't want to look like a hubristic tech company swooping in to disrupt an industry we knew little about: we needed a brand that communicated our strong connection to the journalism industry.
